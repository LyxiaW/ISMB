## Pianorama Junior Course

*For 4 – 6 year olds – Grouped in age in small classes.*

Pianorama Junior Music Course comprises all the elements required to develop musical and technical skills for the young beginner. The curriculum is specifically written to encompass a wide range of musical activity, which enables concentration levels to be kept at the optimum during the lesson. A focus on developing a musical ear accelerates the process of achievement. Our classrooms are equipped with a digital piano for each student in the classroom, as well as a full range of percussion instruments. Magnetic music boards for all students simplify theoretical work and all piano pieces are learnt with the additional support of speed variable backing tracks. Our teachers are qualified both musically and in teaching young students.
